        <p>I love content creation and optimizing that content for the best user experience. In my role as outreach coordinator at the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, Iâ€™m able to build and tailor a huge variety of content across platforms to help us
          educate and connect with our constituency. From social media to e-learning course and web content development, I thrive on creating and connecting people with quality content.</p>

        <p>My graduate background is in writing, which has allowed me to pivot with a surprising amount of dexterity into developing new interests and skills. The writing process is often just as much about logic and critical thinking as it is about
          creativity, and has enabled me to expand my personal definition of content creation beyond just the written word. I'll always have a deep love for writing, but in pursuit of knowledge and skill, I've recently developed a passion for coding
          and web development. As long as a project requires a keen eye for detail and includes a lot of latitude for creativity, I want to be involved!</p>

        <p>When I'm not building projects at work, I'm building them at home. I write (and even occasionally publish) fiction of the sci-fi and fantasy variety&mdash;I have a big imagination and need a correspondingly big playground! You can also
          find me developing my personal coding projects, experimenting with different types of tea, teaching myself to cook Japanese cuisine, and sneaking a video game or two somewhere in the margins. </p>
